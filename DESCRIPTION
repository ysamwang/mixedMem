Description: Fits mixed membership models with discrete multivariate data (with
    or without repeated measures) following the general framework of Erosheva et
    al (2004). This package includes a Variational EM and MCMC estimation approaches.
    Currently supported data types are Bernoulli, multinomial and rank (Plackett-Luce).
    The extended GoM model with fixed stayers from Erosheva et al (2007) is now also supported.
    See Airoldi et al (2014) for other examples of mixed membership models.
