Description: Fits mixed membership models with discrete multivariate data (with
    or without repeated measures) following the general framework of Erosheva
    et al 2004. This package uses a Variational EM approach by approximating
    the posterior distribution of latent memberships and selecting
    hyperparameters through a pseudo-MLE procedure. Currently supported data
    types are Bernoulli, multinomial and rank (Plackett-Luce). See Airoldi et
    al (2014) for other examples of mixed membership models.
