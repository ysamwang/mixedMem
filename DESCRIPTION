Description: mixedMem fits mixed membership models with discrete multivariate
    data (with or withour replacements) following the general framework of
    Erosheva 2004. mixedMem uses a Variational EM approach by approximating the
    posterior distribution of latent memberships and selecting hyperparameters
    through a pseudo-MLE procedure. Currently supported data types are
    Bernoulli, multinomial and rank (Plackett-Luce).
